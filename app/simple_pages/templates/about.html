    <div style="font-size: 16px;">My name is Jason Cordova and I'm currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. <br><br>I started teaching myself how to program since I was 8 years old and decided to carry out the hobby as a career path. As of now, I've begun experimenting with web development, database technologies, and software development. I decided to take this course after my time in IT202 last semester, which peaked my interest in developing websites. <br><br>Feel free to use the navigation bar on top to upload or browse your own transactions/deposits/withdraws.</div>
